    "We implement the SGHMC described in paper Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo by Chen et al (2014). This specific HMC largely decreases the computation complexity by applying a stochastic gradient calcuted on minibatchs of data with noise and counterbalances that noise by a friction term. We implemented the algorithm in python, and tested optimizations utilizing ```numba```, ```cppimport``` and ```multiprocess```. We test the behavior of SGHMC on two examples compared to other two MCMC methods.One of them is the normal HMC from pyhmc package, and the another one is from pystan package.There is an up-to-date [Github repository](https://github.com/Senlody/SGHMC) (https://github.com/Senlody/SGHMC) .

    "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 2010) is an advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method. Rather than using a traditionally statistical way to find a proposal distribution, HMC introduce the definition of potential energy and kinetic energy from physics to find a proposal distribution. However, there is a limitation for HMC, which is the requirement to compute the gradient of the potential energy function during a sampling process. This problem could be addressed when the data size is small. Nonetheless, with the increasing data size in real world analysis, calculating the gradient of potential energy for whole dataset is very costly and time consuming. In order to address the weakness in HMC, the paper Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo by Chen et al (2014) develops an advanced version of HMC to sidestep the inner limitation.Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) works the same way as HMC but is different from their inner computation. Instead of calculating the gradient of potential energy function for whole dataset, SGHMC applies a stochastic gradient on minibatches of data with a certain degree noise and then counteracts that noise with a “friction” term.\n",
    "\n",
    "SGHMC can be appliled in any situation where MCMC methods are needed and it also takes advantage of producing low correlation samples during the sampling procedure, while also decreasing the computation cost especially when data size is large. This allows a more efficient exploration in the state space. One limitation of SGHMC is that users need to approximate many variables initially compared to other algorithms and different setups may lead to different target distributions. Another limitation is that the stochastic gradient calculated based on minibatches of data may be inappropriate since the observation size is not enough."

The way we set up the initial value above is in order to conform with the original values in paper. we choose the effective sample size to be 6000. The following graphs are density plots of sampled $\\theta$ in three different methods. As we can see, the denity plots of Pystan and SGHMC are very similar to the true distribution. However, the graph of pyhmc shows that it does not sample a distribution that is close to true distribution compared to other two. Then we try to increase the sample size in pyhmc to 10000 or even bigger. The pyhmc graph is still similar to original one, which indicates pyhmc is not as good as the other two. \n",

The effective sample size is also 6000. The behavior of pyhmc is quiet poor. It takes relatively long time to run the sampling process and the outcome shows that pyhmc doesn't explore the state space at all. The sampled $\\mu$ values are far away from the true $\\mu$. If we set $\\epsilon$ to value greater than 0.03, there are even no plots shown in kernel density plot. For pystan and ```sghmc```, even though their graphs look a little bit different, they actually represent the same thing since two circles in pystan graph are symmetric. That means $\\theta$ sometimes jumps from -3 to 3 or 3 to -3 in the sampling process, which is reasonable because $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are symmetric in the problem. In order for SGHMC to give a same simulation as HMC, we run the example again with ```sghmc_chains``` to run multiple simulations and expect them to cover both two circles. The result is ideal.

Despite the comparatible results shown above, pystan is acutually better than SGHMC in the given examples. Pystan is quite simple to use since we only need to pass some distributions and data into function.
